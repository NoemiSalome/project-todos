# Project Todos
This weeks project was about pulling together all the parts of redux und building it's structure from scratch.

## The problem
First of all I started by sketching the app on paper. Mondays lecture already gave a good idea how to start and set up everything. I had (still have) a bit of a hard time wraping my head around the whole thing. The concept is hard to grasp for me and at some point I just had to accept that I don't fully understand what's going on in my code otherwise I wouldn't be able to hand it in. 
This week I wanted to work with styled components and as it turns out I prefer it this way. It makes the styling process more structured and quicker. I found all the answers in the recordings of the lectures, on stackoverflow and google. Also thanks to youtube I was able to implement a lottie animation.
